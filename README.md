We would like a web application that allows users to list spaces they have available, and to hire spaces for the night.

- Create and structure a plan for the week
### Stand-up management ###
- Manage stand-up meetings efficiently and with a solution focus
### Retrospectives ###
- Analyse daily progress to elicit weaker topic area focus
